                Hello! My name is Soren, and I'm a Junior at Fairfax High School!
                I'm really passionate about math and computer science, and perform
                in my school's theatre productions for most of the year. Having to
                stay at school until 6pm (although this can sometimes be as late as 10pm!)
                every night is incredibly stressful, but it's taught me to maintain a healthy 
                work-life balance, and is a reason I have been able to maintain my grades, even
                as school is beginning to get much more difficult.
            </p>
